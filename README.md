# CPSC 210 Personal Project - Phase 0

## Project idea

For my personal project, I plan on making a badminton match tracker. 

## Overview

It will allow users to record and save a log of badminton matches (their own or otherwise), match results, who played, 
what event it was, how long it lasted, when it happened, and notes about the match. This project is of interest to me 
as I play badminton, but more so because I enjoy watching professional badminton, and a lot of information the 
commentators have access to is not available on the Badminton World Federation's website. This includes:

- Player win rate
- ***Head-to-head statistics*** 
  - This is the feature that I want to use the most
- Number of titles won
- Success rate by round (final, semifinal, quarterfinal, etc.)
- Win rate against players/pairs of a specific nation
- **Win rate against top x (8, 10, 16...) ranked players** 
  - I would also really like to implement this

I therefore plan on implementing some or all of these features in addition to the ones listen before, which may require
tangential features (i.e. player ranking at time of match, player nation).

## Potential Users

First and foremost, I will use this application to track statistics about players or pairs I am interested in. However,
the application will have the tools to be useful to a variety of users. Professional badminton players or their coaches
can use it to keep a record of their matches and may use the statistics to inform their strategy and training when 
facing specific opponents. They can also use the ability to write notes about a match to record their post-game 
thoughts after each match they play. Recreational players can use the app much the same, though the statistics will 
simply be for fun for them. Finally, people who only watch badminton can also use the app for the same reasons I will.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add a badminton match to my match log with a score, record of players, type of event, and notes
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of my previous badminton matches
- As a user, I want to be able to record my matches and matches not involving me in separate categories
- As a user, I want to be able to edit the details of a match after saving it to my match log
Phase 2
- As a user, I want to be able to save my match log to file (if I so choose)
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my match log from a file (if I so choose)
